# Unity Burst Intrinsics 

Ive updated some functions i often use using interincs in unity burst and thought to share it here as it might be handy for reference for others. 


AllEqual.cs -> check if all floats in the array are equal to eachother 

AllEquallySpaced.cs -> check if all pointers in the array point to data that is equally spaced
